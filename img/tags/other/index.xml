      <description>&lt;p&gt;Variable prevalence and treatment of breakthrough pain (BTP) in different clinical contexts are partially due to the lack of reliable/validated diagnostic tools with prognostic capability.  We  report  the  statistical  basis  and  performance  analysis  of  a  novel  BTP  scoring  system based on the naïve Bayes classifier (NBC) approach and an 11-item IQ-BTP validated questionnaire. This system aims at classifying potential BTP presence in three likelihood classes: “High,” “Intermediate,” and “Low.”&lt;/p&gt;
