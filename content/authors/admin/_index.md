I am a 3rd year PhD student in Statistics under the supervision of [Dr Julia Brettschneider](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/statistics/staff/academic-research/brettschneider) (Warwick), [Prof Thomas Nichols](https://www.bdi.ox.ac.uk/Team/t-e-nichols) (Oxford Big Data Institute) and [Dr Shahin Tavakoli](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/statistics/staff/academic-research/tavakoli/) (Warwick). I am part of a joint CDT program between the University of Oxford and the University of Warwick called OxWaSP.

I am interested in the development of statistical methods for the analysis of neuroimaging data. The analysis of brain scans represents nowadays a challenge for statisticians due to the inherent high dimensionality and the internal spatial structure. From a theoretical point of view, I am currently modelling these aspects using functional data analysis.
