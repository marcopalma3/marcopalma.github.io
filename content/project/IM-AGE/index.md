Tensor-based morphometry (TBM) is an imaging technique that aims at showing
local differences in brain volume with respect to a common template.
TBM images are smooth but they exhibit (especially in diseased group)
higher values in some brain regions called lateral ventricles. The study of TBM images might inform about ageing effects and neurodegenerative diseases.
