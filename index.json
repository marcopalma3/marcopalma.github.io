However, existing studies typically neglect the uncertainty of these predictions. In this work we take into account this uncertainty by applying methods of functional data analysis. We propose a penalised functional quantile regression model of age on brain structure with cognitively normal (CN) subjects in the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), and use it to predict brain age in Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) subjects. Unlike the machine learning approaches available in the literature of brain age prediction, which provide only point predictions, the outcome of our model is a prediction interval for each subject.","tags":["Neuroimaging","Brain age","Functional data analysis","Tensor-based morphometry","Functional quantile regression"],"title":"Quantifying uncertainty in brain-predicted age using scalar-on-image quantile regression","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Words might change their meanings over time.

If we consider word meaning, which is the scope of lexical semantics, we observe that some words have several meanings, thus displaying lexical polysemy. In this article, we present the first phase of a project that aims at computationally modelling Ancient Greek semantics over time. Our system is based on Bayesian learning and on the Diorisis Ancient Greek corpus, which we have built for this purpose. We illustrate preliminary results in light of expert annotation, and take this opportunity to discuss the role of computational systems and human analysis in a complex research area like historical semantics.","tags":["Linguistics","Ancient Greek"],"title":"A computational approach to lexical polysemy in Ancient Greek","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Valerio Perrone","Marco Palma","Simon Hengchen","Alessandro Vatri","Jim Q.

Associating a word's correct meaning in its historical context is a central challenge in diachronic research, and is relevant to a range of NLP tasks, including information retrieval and semantic search in historical texts. Bayesian models for semantic change have emerged as a powerful tool to address this challenge, providing explicit and interpretable representations of semantic change phenomena. However, while corpora typically come with rich metadata, existing models are limited by their inability to exploit contextual information (such as text genre) beyond the document time-stamp. This is particularly critical in the case of ancient languages, where lack of data and long diachronic span make it harder to draw a clear distinction between polysemy (the fact that a word has several senses) and semantic change (the process of acquiring, losing, or changing senses), and current systems perform poorly on these languages. We develop GASC, a dynamic semantic change model that leverages categorical metadata about the texts' genre to boost inference and uncover the evolution of meanings in Ancient Greek corpora. In a new evaluation framework, our model achieves improved predictive performance compared to the state of the art.","tags":["Linguistics","Ancient Greek"],"title":"GASC: Genre-Aware Semantic Change for Ancient Greek","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Tensor-based morphometry (TBM) is an imaging technique that aims at showing local differences in brain volume with respect to a common template.
