The variability of individual lung function measurements over time (within-individual variability) has been shown to predict subsequent lung function changes. Nevertheless, the association between within-individual lung function variability and demographic and genetic covariates is not quantified. We performed a longitudinal analysis of data from a cohort of 7099 adults with cystic fibrosis (between 18 and 49 years old) from the UK cystic fibrosis registry, containing annual review data between 1996 and 2020. A mixed-effects location-scale model is used to quantify mean FEV1 (forced expiratory volume in 1 second) trajectories and FEV1 within-individual variability as a function of sex, age at annual review, age at diagnosis, genotype and birth cohort. Mean FEV1 decreased with age and lung function variability showed an approximately quadratic trend by age. Males showed higher FEV1 mean and variability than females across the whole age range. Individuals who died during follow-up showed on average higher lung function variability than those who survived. This work opens new avenues for further research to understand the role of within-individual lung function variability in disease progression and prediction of key outcomes such as mortality.","tags":["Within-individual variability","Cystic fibrosis","MELSM"],"title":"Factors associated with within-individual variability of lung function for people with cystic fibrosis: a longitudinal registry study","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Valerio Perrone","Simon Hengchen","Marco Palma","Alessandro Vatri","Jim Q Smith","Barbara McGillivray"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1611273600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1611273600,"objectID":"347e9f9f7aff0a7c5ee67d5e296283f8","permalink":"/publication/semantic-change-chapter/","publishdate":"2021-01-22T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/semantic-change-chapter/","section":"publication","summary":"Change and its precondition, variation, are inherent in languages. Over time, new words enter the lexicon, others become obsolete, and existing words acquire new senses. Associating a word's correct meaning in its historical context is a central challenge in diachronic research. Historical corpora of classical languages, such as Ancient Greek and Latin, typically come with rich metadata, and existing models are limited by their inability to exploit contextual information beyond the document timestamp. While embedding-based methods feature among the current state of the art systems, they are lacking in the interpretative power. In contrast, Bayesian models provide explicit and interpretable representations of semantic change phenomena. In this chapter we build on GASC, a recent computational approach to semantic change based on a dynamic Bayesian mixture model. In this model, the evolution of word senses over time is based not only on distributional information of lexical nature, but also on text genres. We provide a systematic comparison of dynamic Bayesian mixture models for semantic change with state-of-the-art embedding-based models. On top of providing a full description of meaning change over time, we show that Bayesian mixture models are highly competitive approaches to detect binary semantic change in both Ancient Greek and Latin.","tags":["Linguistics","Ancient Greek"],"title":"Lexical semantic change for Ancient Greek and Latin","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Laura Bigoni","Marco Palma"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1611187200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1611187200,"objectID":"8a8305aa49d90242c01889da3fcd0058","permalink":"/publication/vortit-it/","publishdate":"2021-01-21T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/vortit-it/","section":"publication","summary":"The task of translating ancient languages into Italian has distinctive features with respect translating from modern, currently spoken languages. The differences are even more pronounced in translation practices at school, where students are still developing familiarity with the source language. In this paper, the main aspects of translationese from ancient languages to Italian in a didactic context are discussed. The linguistic arguments at the base of this concept are also supported by a preliminary quantitative analysis performed on a pilot corpus, which indicates that simple statistical models can distinguish texts originally written in Italian and those translated from Latin with high accuracy. These interdisciplinary considerations reveal the need for collecting and analyzing high school students’ translations through an ad hoc experiment, and some practical guidelines are proposed.","tags":["Linguistics","Translationese"],"title":"Vortit Italice.

Associating a word's correct meaning in its historical context is a central challenge in diachronic research, and is relevant to a range of NLP tasks, including information retrieval and semantic search in historical texts. Bayesian models for semantic change have emerged as a powerful tool to address this challenge, providing explicit and interpretable representations of semantic change phenomena. However, while corpora typically come with rich metadata, existing models are limited by their inability to exploit contextual information (such as text genre) beyond the document time-stamp. This is particularly critical in the case of ancient languages, where lack of data and long diachronic span make it harder to draw a clear distinction between polysemy (the fact that a word has several senses) and semantic change (the process of acquiring, losing, or changing senses), and current systems perform poorly on these languages. We develop GASC, a dynamic semantic change model that leverages categorical metadata about the texts' genre to boost inference and uncover the evolution of meanings in Ancient Greek corpora.
